# Comedy Night Chat-Bot

## 💡 Inspiration

You need someone to lift your spirits and restore your **sense of joy in life** if you ever feel lonely, worn out, or bored.
I created a chat box that has the same **comedic night** the feeling as those Sony and HBO Max shows.

- When you ask a question, the bot will respond with an **original,humorous** response that you have never heard before,
- which will pass the time and put a **smile** on your face.
